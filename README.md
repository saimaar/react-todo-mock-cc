This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React ToDo List

## Setup

Run `npm install`

To get you going, we've got a backend with todos! To get these, you're going to have to do the following:

1. Run `json-server --watch db.json`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/todos` to confirm delivery of sushi!

Let's run the app with `npm run start` or `npm start`

## Background

We have a React To Do List. We want the App to manage which ones are Completed and which ones are Incomplete (too lazy to keep track).
We will fetching the list of To Dos from the json server and rendering each onto the page while organizing which ones go in the appropriate category. At the same time, we want to be able to add and remove todos from the list.

Ultimately, we want our App to look something like:

## Deliverables

* Fetch the data from http://localhost:3000/todos
* Render the each todo in the appropriate component
* Each todo card will have button to change the complete status which will conditionally render based on the location of component. (i.e if a todo is under the Complete, the button text should say Incomplete and vice-versa.)

Here is a gif of what it's supposed to look:

* Add a new todo. Make a POST request to http://localhost:3000/todos. 
Don't forget: 
```
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({})
```
* When the todo is successfully created in the server, make sure it is also rendered in React.
* Delete a todo. Make a DELETE request to http://localhost:3000/todos/:id
Don't forget:
```
    method: "DELETE"
```
* When the todo is successfully deleted, also remove from React.

Here is a gif of what it's supposed to look:

* Incorporate the SearchBarComponent within the Incomplete Component to filter out todos. As you type, the Incomplete todos are dynamically rendered. 

Here is a gif of what it's supposed to look:

### Bonus

* Notice the Complete and Incomplete Components are bit redundant. Anyway to reuse just one component for both of them? (You may have to restructure a component to make this successfully work.)
